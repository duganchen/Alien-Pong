Alien Pong
==========

This is an old school project from my BCIT days. It requires the following dependencies:

* [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org)  (tested with 2.1),
* [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com),
* [FTGL](http://ftgl.wiki.sourceforge.net)

To compile, build and run from the Linux command-line, use the following commands:

	qmake
	make
	./alienpong

Use the cursor keys to control the right paddle. W and S move the left paddle up and down, respectively.

Please note that as this was an academic project, it was not implemented with distribution in mind. What this means is that I did not choose assets that were free from copyright or licensed for distribution. I hope this isn't a problem. In the interest of full disclosure, here's where everything's from:

* The background music is from Epic Pinball.
* The sound effects are from findsounds.com.
* The graphics, as far as I remember, are either from the Hubble space telescope archive, or modified to the point of not being recognizable.
* The score font is one whose source I do not recall.

If I have violated your copyright, please let me know immediately.
