Alien Pong
==========

This is a school project from BCIT. It requires the following dependencies:

* [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org),
* [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com),
* [FTGL](http://ftl.wiki.sourceforge.net)

To compile, build and run from the Linux command-line, use the following commands:

>qmake
>make
>./alienpong

Use the cursor keys to control the right paddle. W and S move the left paddle up and down, respectively.

The background music is from Epic Pinball. I do not have the copyright on it. All sounds are from findsounds.com. All of the graphics, as far as I remember, are either from the Hubble space telescope archive, or modified to the point of not being recognizable. I cannot remember where I got the score font. I hope that none of this is a problem.
